Subject: Re: Garmin Connect Developer Program - StepSquad Project Clarification

Dear Garmin Connect Developer Program Team,

Thank you for your follow-up regarding my access request to the Garmin Connect Developer Program.

To clarify the nature of this project:

**I am not developing for a third-party client.** StepSquad is a fitness competition platform that I am developing as a product of my own company. It is an independent SaaS platform that enables teams and organizations to create and participate in step-based fitness competitions.

**About StepSquad:**
- **Platform Name:** StepSquad
- **Website:** https://www.stepsquad.club
- **Purpose:** A competitive fitness platform that brings teams together to compete in step challenges, with real-time leaderboards and AI-powered insights
- **Target Users:** Companies, organizations, and communities looking to run team-based fitness challenges
- **Integration:** The platform integrates with Garmin Connect and Fitbit via OAuth to collect verified step data from participants' devices

**Short-term Goal:**
I am participating in the Google Cloud Run Hackathon with StepSquad, where the Garmin Connect API integration will be a key feature demonstrating real-world device connectivity and data synchronization.

**Technical Details:**
- StepSquad is built on Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run services)
- Uses OAuth 1.0a for Garmin Connect integration
- The platform will sync step data from users' linked Garmin devices to power team competitions and leaderboards

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to becoming part of the Garmin Connect Developer Program.

Best regards,
