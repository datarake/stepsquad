fix: Fix E2E tests and Vitest configuration

## Fixes

### E2E Tests
- Fixed "admin can create competition" test:
  - Simplified to wait for navigation instead of API response
  - Use unique competition IDs/names to avoid conflicts
  - Fixed timeout issues by using waitForURL instead of waitForResponse

- Fixed "user can login" test:
  - Made ADMIN badge selector more specific to avoid ambiguity
  - Filter selector to match exact "ADMIN" text

- Fixed "member cannot access create page" test:
  - Check for specific access denied heading and message
  - Use more specific selectors

### Vitest Configuration
- Excluded e2e directory from Vitest tests
- E2E tests should run separately with Playwright

## Test Results
- ✅ Backend: 15/15 tests passing
- ✅ Frontend: 8/8 tests passing  
- ✅ E2E: 5/5 tests passing
- Total: 28/28 tests passing
